# Encrypter-tool
In Encrypter tool v1.0.exe, insert whatever text you would like to be encrypted into the first box (top-left), next create a password (must be an int) and hit encrypt. The encrypted equivalent of your text will have been outputed into the bottom left box, simply copy the text, remember the password and do whatever you want with the encrypted text.
If you want to decrypt the text, simply insert it into the box in the to right, enter the password and hit decrypt! If the password was correct you should now have the original text.
